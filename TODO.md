# TODO

In order of importance, somewhat.. 

- Custom ssl certificate saving to disk and usage in nginx configs
- Dashboard stats are caching instead of querying
- Create a nice way of importing from v1 let's encrypt certs and config data
- UI Log tail
- Custom Nginx Config Editor

Testing:

- Access Levels
  - Adding a proxy host without access to read certs or access lists 
- Visibility
- Forwarding
- Cert renewals
- Custom certs
